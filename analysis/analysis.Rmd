# Power analysis

We conducted a power analysis to specify the number of test trials in the experiment. The details of this analysis can be found in the file [`/analysis/power_analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/manuelbohn/bonoboubakiki/blob/master/analysis/power_analysis.Rmd). The results of this power analysis suggested that when assuming a true effect of 65% correct responses with 300 test trials our model would support the conclusion that performance was above chance in 88/100 cases (see Figure \@ref(fig:simres)).

```{r, cache = T}
sim_res_300_p65 <-readRDS("saves/sim_300_p65.rds")

sim_res_int_p65 <- sim_res_300_p65 %>%
  filter(term == "b_Intercept")%>%
  mutate(estimate = plogis(estimate),
         lower = plogis(lower),
         upper = plogis(upper), 
         inf = ifelse(lower<.5, "true", "false"))
```

```{r simres, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "Power analysis based on 100 simulations with a true effect of 65\\% correct responses and 300 test trials. Points show the model intercept for each simulation (with with 95\\% CrI). Simulations in red yielded a wrong conclusion.", out.width="100%"}

# Descriptives

## Number of Trials

Table \@ref(tab:trialtab) gives the number of trials per condition. There were 30 sessions in total, each with 10 test trials. Because of a software error, two regular trials were missing in session 1 and 2 (see main paper for detail). 

```{r trialtab}
t1 <- data %>%
  group_by(condition)%>%
  summarise(n = n())

knitr::kable(t1, caption = "Number of trials per condition.", digits = 2, align = "l")
```

# Reaction times

Figure \@ref(fig:rtplot) visualizes the reaction times by correct choice and trial type. 

```{r rtplot, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "Reactions times for regular and test trials split by correct and incorrect responses.", out.width="100%"}

saveRDS(bm_rt, "saves/model_rt.rds")

bm_rt <-readRDS("saves/model_rt.rds")

```

Figure \@ref(fig:rtrial) shows the change in reaction time over time. Reaction times are relatively stable across time and changed in similar ways in regular and test trials.

```

This impression was confirmed in a linear mixed model in which we predicted reaction time by condition and trial. The model had the following structure: 

`RT ~ condition* z_trial + (z_trial | SampleSound )`

Because reaction times tend to be skewed and have an offset, we modeled the response as a `shifted_lognormal` distribution. Figure \@ref(fig:rtmodel) visualizes the model estimates, showing a negative effect of condition and a small negative effect of trial but no interaction between condition and trial. Thus, reaction times were generally faster in test trials compared to regular trials, but they did not change differently over time for the two trial types.

# Results

```{r}
test_data <- data %>%
  filter(condition == "test")%>%
  mutate(z_trial = scale(cont_trial))

regular_data <- data %>%
  filter(condition == "regular")%>%
  mutate(z_trial = scale(cont_trial))
```

## Test trials 

### Comparison to chance

We used a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model with a logit link to analyze performance. Our model hat the following structure: 

`correct ~ 1 + (z_trial | SampleSound )`

In this a model, the intercept models the average rate of correct responses. A value of 0 in link space corresponds to a proportion of correct choices of 0.5. Thus, we inferred that if the 95% credible interval (CrI) around the posterior estimate for the intercept did not include 0, performance was reliably above chance. Figure \@ref(fig:ttmodel) visualizes the posterior distribution based on our model. It shows that the 95%CrI overlaps with 0. We therefore concluded that Kanzi's performance in test trials was not reliably above chance. 

```{r, cache = T}
# model takes a minute or two to initialize and run.
# load rds file if you don't want to wait or if you want to reproduce the exact numbers in the manuscript

# bm_test <- brm(correct ~ 1 + (z_trial | SampleSound ), # + (z_trial | shape_combination),

#### Prior sensitivity analysis

The model reported above used default priors as implemented in the `brms` package. Here we explore the effect of different prior distributions for the intercept estimate on the results. The default prior in `brms` is `student_t(3, 0, 2.5)`. We compare this to three other priors. A weak prior `normal(0, 10)`, a medium prior `normal(0, 5)`, and a strong prior `normal(0, 1)`. Figure \@ref(fig:priorsens) visualizes the estimates given the different prior distributions and shows that the prior settings had little to no influence on the posterior estimate in the model. 

```{r}
# weak_prior <- prior(normal(0, 10), class="Intercept")
# medium_prior <- prior(normal(0, 5), class="Intercept")
# strong_prior <- prior(normal(0, 1), class="Intercept")

#### Subset analysis

```{r}
sel_words = c("keke","kiki","pepe","pipi","lulu","lolo","mumu","momo","nono","nunu")

test_data_sel <- test_data%>%
  mutate(SampleSound = substr(SampleSound, 1, nchar(SampleSound)-4))%>%
  filter(SampleSound %in% sel_words)
```

In McCormick et al. (2015), some pseudo words were rated as more sound symbolic than others. These words were: `keke`,`kiki`,`pepe`,`pipi`,`lulu`,`lolo`,`mumu`,`momo`,`nono`,`nunu`. Given that these words are perceived as more sound symbolic in humans, Kanzi's performance might have been higher in trials with just these words. We therefore re-ran the model on a subset of the test trials that included only these words. This reduces the number of trials to `r length(test_data_sel$SampleSound)`. Figure \@ref(fig:ttsel) shows that the average rate of correct responses was the same when estimated based on trials with only highly sound symbolic pseudo words compared to all trials.

```{r}
# 
# bm_test_sel <- brm(correct ~ 1 + (z_trial | SampleSound ),
#           data = test_data_sel,
#           family = bernoulli(),
#           cores = 4,
#           chains = 4,

### Shape preference

For humans, it has been repeatedly found that sound symbolism effects are stronger for round shapes compared to edgy shapes. We therefore ran a model estimating the rate of correct responses on test trials with round compared to edgy shapes. This model had the following structure: 

`correct ~ test_shape + (z_trial | SampleSound )`

Figure \@ref(fig:tshape) shows that while performance was slightly higher with round compared to edgy shapes, it was nevertheless not reliably different from a level expected by chance. 

```{r, cache = T}
# load .rds file if you don't want to run the model

# bm_shape <- brm(correct ~ test_shape + (z_trial | SampleSound ), #+ (z_trial | shape_combination),
#           data = test_data,

  guides(fill = F)+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Regular trials

### Comparison to chance

Test trials were embedded in regular trials in which Kanzi had to match a word to a picture (cropped and converted to gray scale). We analysed these regular trials in the same way as the test trials using the following model: 

`correct ~ 1 + (z_trial | SampleSound )`

Figure \@ref(fig:rtmodel) shows that the posterior estimate for the intercept was clearly positive and the 95% CrI did not overlap with 0. Thus, Kanzi was clearly able to matcht the sounds to the correct pictures. 

```{r, cache = T}
# model takes long time to run

# bm_regular <- brm(correct ~ 1 + (z_trial | SampleSound ),# + (z_trial | shape_combination),
#           data = regular_data,
#           family = bernoulli(),
#           cores = 4,
#           chains = 4,
#           iter = 5000,
#           control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth = 20))

#saveRDS(bm_regular, "saves/model_regular.rds")

bm_regular <- readRDS("saves/model_regular.rds")
```

## Results by word

Figure \@ref(fig:resw) shows the proportion of correct responses for each word used in regular and test trials. Each regular word appeared between 26 and 28 times and each sound symbolic test word appeared 15 times.
